# Design-and-Development-of-Olive-Pitting-and-Grading-Machine
Final Year Project
â€” The invention in the technological world in Olive processing industry which increases the demand of the Olive industry. Olive pitting machine is mainly used for crushing and pitting of olives. The destoning of olive is the major area of concern in this project. A prototype is designed known as semi-autonomous machine for the extraction of olive and pitting process. Our Project is mainly focus on the Design of the Olive pitting Machine & Grading Machine. 
This machine will operate on no of mechanisms such as Geneva and slider crank mechanism. The assembly of machine is designed keeping in mind that all sizes of olives can be placed in one go on which pitting process need to be carried out. The major concern of our project lies in passing olives through fruit grading machine and then after this put that passed Olive into the Olive Pitting Machine whose task is to remove the seeds or pits of olives successfully the without damaging the outer part of the fruit.
 The project we have chosen for our FYP has both commercial and industrial value. The project holds to remove pit from olives mesh and then these olives can serve application in foods we are used on daily basis like tables olives, pickled olives and for extracting olives oil. Our area of target is to design a prototype whose specifications is grading olive one their sizes and destoning of pits.
