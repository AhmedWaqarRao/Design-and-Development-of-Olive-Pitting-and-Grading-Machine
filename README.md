— The invention in the technological world in Olive processing industry which increases the demand of the Olive industry. Olive pitting machine is mainly used for crushing and pitting of olives. The destoning of olive is the major area of concern in this project. A prototype is designed known as semi-autonomous machine for the extraction of olive and pitting process. Our Project is mainly focus on the Design of the Olive pitting Machine & Grading Machine. 
This machine will operate on no of mechanisms such as Geneva and slider crank mechanism. The assembly of machine is designed keeping in mind that all sizes of olives can be placed in one go on which pitting process need to be carried out. The major concern of our project lies in passing olives through fruit grading machine and then after this put that passed Olive into the Olive Pitting Machine whose task is to remove the seeds or pits of olives successfully the without damaging the outer part of the fruit.
 The project we have chosen for our FYP has both commercial and industrial value. The project holds to remove pit from olives mesh and then these olives can serve application in foods we are used on daily basis like tables olives, pickled olives and for extracting olives oil. Our area of target is to design a prototype whose specifications is grading olive one their sizes and destoning of pits.
I.	Introduction
Olive industry is growing day by day with the in interventions of technological solutions in olives process industry. The project holds to remove pit from olives mesh and then these olives can serve application in foods like tables olives and oil can also be extracted from the oils and is also used in pickels. We are to design a semi-automated machine whose function is to remove pit form olives [1].
There are 3 major parts in this semi-automated machine i.e., Olive feeder, Olive carrier, Pit detaching device. Olive feeder is the only semi-automatic part of the machine. In olive feeder olives need to be placed in such a way that it is in perfect contact with tip of needle and needle strike them longitudinally. 

Olive carrier is a revolving drum with sockets to hold various sizes of olives in predetermined position. The 24V motor is needed to rotate this drum and when needle encounter olive means when it strikes the olive then drum stop rotating. Pit detaching device consists of system of 9 needles which is capable of destoning 9 olives in just one go. The invention in the technological world in Olive processing industry which increases the demand of the Olive industry [3].

Olive pitting machine is mainly used for crushing and pitting of olives [2]. Our Project is mainly focus on the Design of the Olive pitting Machine & Grading Machine. The major objective of the of this project first to pass the olive through the Grading Machine and then after this put that passed Olive into the Olive Pitting Machine which successfully remove the pit of the olives without fracturing the outer part of the fruit [4]. The pitted Olive fruit can give us the income generating tool by making olive table oils, pickled olive and sliced or chopped olives can be use on pizza etc.


The Selected design of the Olive Extracting Machine resembles the cherry machine with modification in the driving mechanism having a Geneva Mechanism Crank-Slider Mechanism for the head of the device with a pitting needle. Holes of Rollers are selected according to the Grade of Olives needed to be pitted after being graded by the Olive Sorting Machine. 
The Pitting Machine Also includes Feeder and Collector Assembly for Feeding and collecting olives, respectively [5]. Mechanical System Based Olive Sorting: Mechanical based system for olive grading is the most used methodology. Mechanical Sorting Consists of Feeder Assembly through which olives are sent to conveyor belts arranged so that they are hollow from the bottom and carry the olives while moving forward.



II.	Methodology
Important paramteres and calculations
A.	DEVELOPMENT PHASE OF PITTING & GRADING MACHINE COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

	The overall parameters of the olive hopper, grading drums with holes; the length and diameters of drums, diameter and total number of holes and exit fall of the development grading-machine are included as follows.

B.	FINAL 3D CADCAM MODEL
This is the final achieved 3D CAD model of olive grading mechanism, after assembling all the parts. We entered the olives in 3 stages. First, we put 5kg of olives then 10kg and in 3rd stage we put 15kg of olives in the hopper, by 220 volts motor placed on the other side of the machine, the rolling drums starts to roll. 

Respective olives fall in 3 different categories according to their diameters which varies from 19mm diameter to 29mm.

After combining various mechanisms and components, the entire assembly of Olive Pit Extractor machine is obtained.
The shaft of the prime mover in the Geneva mechanism is connected to the crank in the slider crank mechanism.

The primary mover's wheel will be turned by an AC induction motor. The crank would generate rotational motion, which would be transformed into linear motion by the slider. The needle box is attached to the slider, and when linear motion is produced, the needle box moves along with the slider to conduct pitting operation.

 When the shaft of the prime mover catches on the slot of the driven wheel, it rotates the roller drum 45 degrees and aligns the roller drum sockets with those of the needle box for correct olive pitting.

        C) Food Grading by Computer Vision:

In this modern era of industrialization, computer vision has become the most influential factor in revolutionizing the food industry. Food grading, including the size, orientation, Volume, weight, color, and checking the quality of a particular food type, has become very easy using computer vision. Machine Learning and Machine Vision make the perfect artificial intelligence system used for food processing. [10]










 1) Working:
 The most used Computer Vision Grading of Olives include    grading by Size and color. Modern image processing techniques are used to distinguish the difference in color and sizes. For imaging, High-Speed Cameras are used to capture images as fast as up to 120 frame rates.

 Data Acquisition Card (DAC) is used to control the system. Machine Learning is a must to process and compare the data to provide the best results. For color identification, Machine Learning techniques are used to easily differentiate between two colors that vary in intensities [11].

G.	7 Results and Discussions 
1)	1. Physical properties of olive fruits:
	
Dimensions, sphericity, mass, volume, actual density, and projected area of olive fruits are shown in Table 1. These statistics were collected on 100 fruit samples using the criteria established. [11]

2)	2. Dimensions of fruit

If the sphericity is less than 0.9; if the sphericity is larger than 1.1, the fruit is classified as oblong. Roundness is assumed for the remaining fruits with intermediate index values [12]	
The majority (85%) of olive in sample were round (sphericity 0.9 - 1.1), with oblong olive fruits accounting for 15% of the sample (sphericity 1.1 - 1.4).
III.	CONCLUSION
Our grading machine established a mechanism for grading and pitting of olive fruits that has vast applications as table oil and used for the extraction of olive’s oil. In addition to project our senior degree we have designed a grading prototype machine for sorting of olives on their sizes. 

The comparison of cost relative to other grading and pitting machines. The procedure we have carried out shows that olive pitting and grading machine holds importance both technically as well as from engineering point of view.

The importance of this machine is obvious from the fact provided that the production of such machines in Pakistan is non-existence due to lack of self-awareness and academic background. 

For pitting of olives, the slider cranks and Geneva mechanism is used but there are high chances of wear and tear of these components so there are utmost requirements of some modifications in this design. Also, in grading machine of olives there are also some errors carried out in making the holes of drum roller for sorting of olives. Some holes are big enough that olives pass through it without going through grading process.

The results we have carried out on this machine are given below:
The maximum fruit damage during pitting and grading process was 6.3 to 6.6%. This was obtained with the grading speed of 8.2rpm (0.08 m/s) and feeding rate of 19kg. With the grading speed of 11.1 rpm the minimum damage obtained was 3.2 to 3.4 % with the fruit size of 20mm and feeding rate of 6kg. The maximum range of grading machine productivity for olives of 112-835 was obtained with grading speed ranging from 6-15 rpm (0.06-0.16 m/s) and feeding rate was 19kg. 

The minimum range of grading machine productivity for olives fruits of 100-685 was obtained with grading speed of 5-14 rpm (0.06-0.15 m/s) and feeding rate of 5kg. The effective cost of our grading machine was from 38-40k.

 The advancement in the machine can made by converting it to fully automatic from semi-automatic machine. In this way labor effort and cost is reduced and high efficiency can be obtained. This advancement in the machine can serve as economic booster in country as there is high demand of olive’s oil.
